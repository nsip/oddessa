1,National Standards Student Attendance Data Reporting ,6.1,,Calculated,Attendance Rate (calculation formula),"The student attendance rate measure is defined as:
the number of actual full time equivalent student-days attended by full-time students in Years 1 to 10 as a percentafe of the total number of possible student-days attended over the period.

The formula for calculating the attendance rate (%) is as follows:

Possible school days are defined as the number of days that a student is expected to attend school over the collection period, as defined in Section 7: Treatment of incidents/absences.",,,,,,"Example 1 shows a scenario of when a student has moved schools during the collection period:
Student A, a full-time student, was enrolled for 40% at school X and 60% at school Y of semester 1. If there were 99 possible school days in semester 1. School X records 40 possible days (40%) and 59 possible days (60%) for school Y.

4,National Standards Student Attendance Data Reporting ,6.4,,Calculated,Proportion of students who attend school 90% or more of possible days (calculation),"The student attendance level measure is defined as:
the proportion of full-time students in Years 1-10 whose attendance rate is greater than or equal to 90 percent over the period.

The formula for calculating the proportion of students who attend school 90% or more (of the time) is as follows:
100 x Sum of possible school days for students attending more than or equal to 90%
_________________________________________________________
                    Sum of possible school days for all students (see 6.3)

The proportion of students who attend school 90% or more of possible days is defined as the sum of possible school days that a student is expected to attend school over the collection period, for students whose actual days (or part-day of) in attendance divided by their possible school days is greater than or equal to 90%, divided by the sum of possible school days for all students.",,,,,,"This formula solves two problems that arise with reporting a simple proportion of students with attendance rates greater than or equal to 90%.  
Firstly, it overcomes a problem that students enrolled at multiple schools during the collection period will be counted multiple times across schools. Secondly, it overcomes a problem that students enrolled at a school for only part of the reporting period are likely to have a lower attendance rate, and therefore unduly influence the simple proportion of students at 90% or more attendance.   
In determining the calculation, the denominator is the same denominator as is used for the average rate of student attendance. The numerator is the sum of possible or enrolled days for students whose actual days divided by their possible days is greater than or equal to 90%.

Refer to document National Standards for Student Attendance Reporting for an example.",,"In calculating the proportion of students who attend school 90% or more of possible days, both the number of possible school days and actual school days attended must be collected at an individual student level.",,,"There is an example scenario in the document National Standards for Student Attendance Data Reporting which relate to this item.

is one who undertakes a workload equivalent to, or greater than that prescribed for a full-time student of that Year (level).

-students enrolled part-time at multiple schools across multiple sectors.
