","A principal is the person designated by the Approved Authority as being responsible for the overall control and administration of the schools.  If a school has multiple locations, a different principal can be reported at each location.  If the same principal works across locations, see instructions for staff at multi-location schools.
Teaching staff are employed or engaged to impart the school curriculum and provide support services.  Teaching staff spend the majority of their work time with students either in direct class contact or on an individual bases. Teachers are usually employed under a State teacher's award or equivalent.

Specialist support functions are of special benefit to students or teaching staff in the development of the school curriculum.  While these staff may spend the majority of their time in contact with students, they are not employed or engaged to impart the school curriculum.
Administrative and Clerical. These are staff whose main function is clerical or administrative.  These include:  Classroom assistant, Library assistant, Teachers' aides, Bursars/School administrators, IT support staff or Accountants.
Building Operations Maintenance and Other Staff.  Staff is only included in this category if their major function is undertaken within school hours and are at the school in the reference period.
",,,,"Staff members are to be reported according to their ‘major function’ rather than their type of appointment, for example; if a staff member spends 70 per cent of their time teaching and 30 per cent of their time on administration duties they would be reported under their ‘major function’ which would be teaching.
