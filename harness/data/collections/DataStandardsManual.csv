The term 'origin' is considered to relate to people's Australian Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent and for some, but not all, their cultural identity.",,,Numeric,1,"‘Indigenous status’ has a hierarchical structure comprising two levels. There are four categories at the detailed level of the classification that are grouped into two categories at the broader level. The classification is as follows:

13 = Both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin
2 = Non-Indigenous
24 = Neither Aboriginal nor Torres Strait Islander origin
9 = Not stated/unknown
Only the second digit of the two-digit code needs to be used for data input and storage purposes. Responses should be coded to the appropriate category of the classification. For example, '24 Neither Aboriginal nor Torres Strait Islander origin' has an input code of '4'.
'Not stated/unknown' ‘Indigenous status’ is to be uniquely represented in information management systems using the code ‘9’.

Four-digit codes ending with two or three zeros are described as 'not further defined' (n.f.d.) codes. These codes are used to code responses that cannot be coded to the most detailed level of the classification but can be coded to a broader level of the classification.
For example: a response 'United Kingdom' does not contain sufficient information to be coded to a particular country but it can be coded to the Minor Group 'United Kingdom' (21) as 'United Kingdom n.f.d.' (2100) which includes all countries in this Group.","Refer tp ABS 1269.0 - Standard Australian Classification of Countries (SACC), 2011",,It is necessary to uniquely identify the ‘Country of birth’ of the student in the collection and storage processes (e.g. on student enrolment forms and in information management systems).,,School Enrolling Student,,ACARA,,StudentPersonal,PersonInfo/Demographics/CountryOfBirth,Descriptor,Student,
