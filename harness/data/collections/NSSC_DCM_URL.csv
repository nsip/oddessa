The ‘Main Language other than English’ is a 4-digit, three level hierarchical coding structure using the ABS: Australian Standard Classification of Languages (ASCL) second edition (ABS cat.no. 1267.0).

Options reflect a standard set of questions, or individualised questions for each state based on common countries of birth by state and territory as identified in the 2006 Population Census.
All question modules from the standard use the ABS: ASCL.
Country of birth is a hierarchical 4 digit category broken down by:
• First digit = Broad Group
• Second digit = Narrow Group
• Third and Fourth digit = Detailed Level.
As a hierarchical structure, if one level is known, all levels above that level are also known.

If the student speaks more than one language at home (not including English), Main Language other than English is the language the student speaks most often. If this cannot be identified then code the first language identified.
Not further defined codes are included in the standard. Not further defined codes include leading zeros.
For example:
If the Broad Group only is known (e.g. Northern European Languages) then 1000 is recorded showing the 1 that identifies the Broad Group and 000 which identifies the unknown Narrow Group and Detailed Level.
If the Detailed Level is known (e.g. Irish) then  1102 is recorded for Irish which also identifies the Narrow Group (11 - Celtic)  and the Broad Group (1 – Northern European Languages)","Data is valid to 4 numerals only. Data is categorical; entries other than prescribed in the ASCL are not valid.
